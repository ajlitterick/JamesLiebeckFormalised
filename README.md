# Formalization of James & Liebeck's "Representations and Characters of Groups"

## Goal
Systematically formalize results from Gordon James and Martin Liebeck's *Representations and Characters of Groups*, Second Edition (2003).

## Approach
- Follow the textbook linearly
- Use existing mathlib results where available (noted in comments)
- Formalize all major theorems and representative examples
- Skip or simplify some routine calculations where appropriate

## Progress

### Chapter 1: Groups and homomorphism
- Work in progress

### Chapters 2-32
- Not yet started

### Solutions to Exercises
- Not yet started

## Mathlib Dependencies
- Will summarise key defintions/theorems used from mathlib as we progress

## Departures from Textbook

- Any deviations from James & Liebeck will be documented here.

## Notes for Lean Learners

- Common patterns used in the formalisation will be documented here.
